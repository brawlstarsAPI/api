# Issues
In this repository, issues are meant for the following purposes:
- Questions about the API
  - It could be a as simple as "How do I get a band tag from a /profile"
- Suggestions for the API
- Feedback towards existing features
- Bearer token blacklist appeals
- To apply for the following section (actually contributing) 

Issues that are meant to spite anger and frustration in the community will be locked and closed.   
If a user continously does that, he might get blocked from the repository and lose access to the API.

# Actually Contributing
By this, I mean making the API.

To contribute in this section, you  must fulfill all of the below requirements:
- Know how to work with the data supercell gives, decrypting it and stuff like that. 
- Already made an existing api, whether it has just one line of information of 20 lines, private or public, as long as I myself can access it for reviewing. 
- Extensive knowledge of the Python language and specifically, version 3.6 with fstrings. 
- Basic knowledge of how ` Python Sanic` works as that is what we are using for the API. 
- Basic knowledge about Heroku and how it works. 
- Used the API before and understand its structure. 


To apply for this, and tell me that you fulfill the above requirements, please create an issue and I'll get in touch with you.

# What about helping out in the moderation of Github issues?
We don't need a team for that at the moment, but might reach out to active members of the community once we need it.

# Pull Requests
I put this topic right at the bottom as it is the least common. The only reason why a pull request should be created **in this repository** is for outdated information.
